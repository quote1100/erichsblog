Responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop views

## Tech Stack

## Future Plans

### Server

- Move everything to docker  
- remove download link for binary file and move it to github  

### Main Page
- Add a background picture that blends in with the design of the blog  
- Add effect when hovering over navigator  
- add 404 page  

### Posts
- Allow line breaks in posts for better formatting  
- Add a **Login** and **Write** button to allow users to log in and write posts directly, eliminating the need for admin panels for each post
